# Na₄Cl₄ Clusters Equilibrium Configurations

This documentation file explains how we implemented the Compphys repository's predefined functions for finding the two equilibrium configurations of Na₄Cl₄ found in the paper [K. Michaelian](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article-abstract/66/3/231/1044856/Evolving-few-ion-clusters-of-Na-and-Cl?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

There are seven configurations for the Na₄Cl₄ tetramer, as shown in the figure.

However, we intended to find the two configurations below.
