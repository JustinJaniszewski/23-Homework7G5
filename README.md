# Homework Task

**Determine the equilibrium configurations of Na_4Cl_4 clusters for tetramers (n=4) in this paper: 
K. Michaelian, "Evolving few-ion clusters of Na and Cl",Am. J. Phys. 66, 231 (1998),shown in Figure 4.** 

Plot the equilibrium configurations using the code in [CompPhys/MinMax/nacl.ipynb](https://github.com/ubsuny/CompPhys/blob/main/MinMax/nacl.ipynb). Label them with their energies. Initialize them to an “ideal” case for the geometry, and allow the optimization to determine the final configurations.

There are 7 configurations, each member of the group chooses 2, then discuss your approach for each individual case. No unit tests necessary this time. Still lint your code.

---

For this you have to complete the following steps:

- Discuss in this repository using issues who will do which configuration (specified above)
- Discuss who should be the main responsible for the repository (the one that can accept merge requests, let me know in discord so I can adjust rights)
- Discuss and generate milestone for your project to optimize the timeline of your project
- Discuss and generate labels for your issues
- Fork this repository
- Merge the necessary fies from the original homework project into your fork
- commit
- create merge requests for your work

Also use discord for discussing solutions to any issues popping up.
